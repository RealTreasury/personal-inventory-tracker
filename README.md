# Personal Inventory Tracker

This demo showcases accessible inventory management pages.

## Usage

- **admin.html** – manage items with fully labeled form controls and confirmation dialogs for delete and bulk adjust actions.
- **index.html** – front-end view of inventory items.

Both interfaces provide helper text and display empty-state messages when no items are present. Data is stored in `localStorage` for simplicity.
