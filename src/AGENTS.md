# AGENTS Instructions

- Files in this directory are written as ES modules and compiled with `esbuild` by running `npm run build`.
- Keep modules small and focused. Avoid `console.log` in committed code.
- Ensure browser compatibility; do not use Node-specific APIs.
- After editing source files, update the compiled outputs in `assets/*.js` and `includes/js/ocr.js`.
