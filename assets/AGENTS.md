# Build Artifacts

All files in this directory are build artifacts produced by `npm run build`.

Contributors should modify source files in `src/` or `blocks/` and then run `npm run build` to update the contents of `assets/`.

The compiled files in this directory must be committed to version control so the plugin works without requiring a build step.
